## About the Project

Simple Subscribe grew out of a desire to allow individuals and organizations to build their own independent subscriber base. It helps you collect emails with a subscription box you can add to any page.

If you're interested in managing your own mailing list or newsletter, you can use Simple Subscribe to collect email addresses. It uses an AWS Lambda to handle subscribe and unsubscribe requests via API, and stores email addresses in a DynamoDB table.

Simple Subscribe handles subscription requests, email confirmations (double opt-in), and unsubscription requests for you. You're free to use your own email solution to mail your recipients.

The daughter project [RSS Mailer](https://github.com/victoriadrake/rss-mailer) offers one option for mailing your list by turning RSS feed items into email messages.

## What this Does

Simple Subscribe will let your visitors:

- Enter their email and hit a **Subscribe** button to sign up.
- Receive a confirmation email in their inbox with a link to finish signing up (double opt-in).
- Send requests to unsubscribe from your list and automatically have their email removed.

Simple Subscribe handles one part of your subscription newsletter flow: allowing people to subscribe! Here are a few things this project does not do:

- Send newsletters to your list.
- Click tracking or other metrics.
- Dance the samba. ðŸ’ƒ

If you'd like to help extend the functionality of this project, please read [Contributing](#contributing).

## How this Works

### Subscribing

Simple Subscribe receives a GET request to your `SUBSCRIBE_PATH` with a query string containing the intended subscriber's email. It then generates an `id` value and adds both `email` and `id` to your DynamoDB table. The table item now looks like:

| email                    | confirm | id           | timestamp           |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| `subscriber@example.com` | _false_ | `uuid-xxxxx` | 2020-11-01 00:27:39 |

### Verifying

After subscribing, the intended subscriber receives an email from SES containing a link. This link takes the format:

```url
<BASE_URL><VERIFY_PATH>/?email=subscriber@example.com&id=uuid-xxxxx
```

Visiting the link sends a request to your `VERIFY_PATH` with the `email` and `id`. Simple Subscribe ensures these values match the database values, then sets `confirm` to `true` and updates the timestamp. The table item now looks like:

| email                    | confirm | id           | timestamp           |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| `subscriber@example.com` | _true_  | `uuid-xxxxx` | 2020-11-01 00:37:39 |

When querying for people to send your newsletter, ensure you only return emails where `confirm` is `true`.

### Providing Unsubscribe Links

Simple Subscribe uses `email` and `id` as arguments to the function that deletes an item from your DynamoDB table. To allow people to remove themselves from your list, provide a URL in emails that includes their `email` and `id` as a query string in the `UNSUBSCRIBE_PATH`. It looks something like:

```url
<BASE_URL><UNSUBSCRIBE_PATH>/?email=subscriber@example.com&id=uuid-xxxxx
```

If the provided `email` and `id` match a database item, that item will be deleted.

## Requirements and Installation

Simple Subscribe now includes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for easier deployment.

The following AWS resources are needed. For set up help, see the provided links.

- [Create a DynamoDB table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-step-1.html) with key `email`, a string. Key names are case-sensitive.
- [Create a Lambda Function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-create-function.html) with `main.go` uploaded as the code, and appropriate environment variables (see below). Ensure it has [permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-permissions.html) to access DynamoDB and SES.
- [Set up an API Gateway trigger](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-apigateway.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_console) for your Lambda. Ensure [`payloadFormatVersion` for your integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html) is `2.0`.
- [Set up AWS Simple Email Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-set-up.html) for sending a subscription confirmation email. If it's your first time sending with SES, you may need to [add and verify your email address or domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html).
- Optionally, if you're interested in giving your API a custom domain, see the [AWS docs on setting up custom domain names for APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html).

The `scripts/` directory has some helpers in it. To use these:

1. [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [set up credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-getting-started-set-up-credentials.html) on your machine.
2. Create a `.env` in this repository's root with the appropriate values as described below.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This project now includes an AWS CloudFormation template (`cloudformation.yaml`) to provision the necessary AWS resources:

- **S3 Bucket**: For storing the Lambda deployment package.
- **IAM Role**: An execution role for the Lambda function with permissions to access DynamoDB and basic Lambda execution.
- **DynamoDB Table**: A table named `SimpleSubscribe` with `email` as the primary key.
- **Lambda Function**: The `simple-subscribe` Lambda function configured with the Go runtime, referencing the S3 bucket for its code and the DynamoDB table name as an environment variable.

To deploy the infrastructure using CloudFormation:

1. **Package your Lambda function**:
    Build your Go application for Linux and zip it. You can adapt the `scripts/update-lambda.sh` script to upload the zip file to the S3 bucket created by CloudFormation.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    set -euxo pipefail
    source .env
    GOOS=linux
    BUILD_NAME=${NAME:-"simple-subscribe"}
    # Replace YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID with your actual AWS account ID or retrieve the bucket name from CloudFormation outputs
    S3_BUCKET_NAME="simple-subscribe-lambda-deployment-YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID" 

    go build -o "$BUILD_NAME" main.go && zip "$BUILD_NAME".zip "$BUILD_NAME"

    echo "Uploading $BUILD_NAME.zip to s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME/"
    aws s3 cp "$BUILD_NAME".zip "s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME/$BUILD_NAME.zip"

    rm "$BUILD_NAME" "$BUILD_NAME".zip
    ```

2. **Deploy the CloudFormation stack**:
    Use the AWS CLI to deploy the `cloudformation.yaml` file.

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation deploy \
        --template-file cloudformation.yaml \
        --stack-name SimpleSubscribeStack \
        --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
    ```

    This command will create or update the CloudFormation stack named `SimpleSubscribeStack` in your AWS account, provisioning all the defined resources.

### Environment Variables for Lambda

The API will look for the following environment variables:

- `DB_TABLE_NAME`: your DynamoDB table
- `BASE_URL`: the address of your site, beginning with `https://` and ending with `/`
- `API_URL`: the endpoint of your API, ending with `/`

As well as these API endpoints:

- `SUBSCRIBE_PATH`: the name of your subscription endpoint, e.g. `signup`
- `UNSUBSCRIBE_PATH`: the name of your unsubscribe endpoint, e.g. `unsubscribe`
- `VERIFY_PATH`: the name of your email verification endpoint, e.g. `verify`
- `SENDER_EMAIL`: the email your confirmation message will be coming from
- `SENDER_NAME`: the name you'd like the confirmation message to come from

As well as these website pages:

- `CONFIRM_SUBSCRIBE_PAGE`: the path of the page your subscriber sees after submitting their email, e.g. `confirm`
- `SUCCESS_PAGE`: the path of the page your subscriber sees when they complete sign up, e.g. `success`
- `ERROR_PAGE`: the path of your error page, e.g. `error`
- `CONFIRM_UNSUBSCRIBE_PAGE`: the path of the page shown after someone successfully unsubscribes, e.g. `unsubscribed`

Pages that your subscriber is sent to after an action are constructed with the base URL in the format `<BASE_URL><SUCCESS_PAGE>`.

You can [input Lambda environment variables in the AWS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html), or use the AWS CLI.

If you're using the AWS CLI, you can pass the environment variables for Lambda in the following shorthand format:

```sh
Variables={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}
```

The script `update-lambda.sh` is provided for convenience. It will upload `main.go` to your Lambda function and replace Lambda environment variables for you by sourcing `.env`. Ensure that `LAMBDA_ENV` is present to hold them.

Here's an example of a suitable `.env` that you can copy and modify:

```text
NAME="simple-subscribe"
DB_TABLE_NAME="SimpleSubscribe"

LAMBDA_ENV="Variables={\
DB_TABLE_NAME=SimpleSubscribe,\
BASE_URL=https://example.com/,\
API_URL=https://api.example.com/,\
ERROR_PAGE=error,\
SUCCESS_PAGE=success,\
CONFIRM_SUBSCRIBE_PAGE=confirm,\
CONFIRM_UNSUBSCRIBE_PAGE=unsubscribed,\
SUBSCRIBE_PATH=signup,\
UNSUBSCRIBE_PATH=unsubscribe,\
VERIFY_PATH=verify,\
SENDER_EMAIL=no-reply@example.com,\
SENDER_NAME='Ford Prefect'}"
```

While none of these are private or secret, it's good practice to have Git ignore environment variables. You can do this with `echo .env >> .gitignore` if it's not already there.

### Create the Sign Up Form

Your visitors will need a form to put their email into. Here's an example HTML snippet:

```html
<!-- Simple Subscribe subscription form begins -->
<div class="form-container">
    <p>Enter your email below to subscribe.</p>
    <div class="form-row" id="subscribe">
        <!-- Change the below 'action' to your API subscribe endpoint -->
        <form action="/your/subscribe/path/" method="get">
            <label hidden for="email">Enter your email to subscribe</label>
            <input type="email" name="email" id="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required>
            <button type="submit" class="primary" value="Subscribe">Subscribe</button>
        </form>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- Subscription form ends -->
```

## Security Considerations

Standard considerations apply:

- Principle of least privilege: ensure your people and functions have only the minimum necessary permissions for accessing each of your AWS resources.
- Encryption: ensure your website is using HTTPS in general, and in particular for requests sent to your API.
- Validation: ensure your subscription form only processes input in the form of valid email addresses. (Most browsers will help you with this if you use `<input type="email" ...>` as in the example above.)

Here are some additional security features you may consider:

### Time-Limited Tokens

The `id` in Simple Subscribe is a UUID that acts as a token to permit verifying or unsubscribing emails. You may wish to expire or rotate these tokens after a certain time frame. You can do this with a periodic clean up (below) or with an AWS Lambda that provides more nuanced timing. Ensure that expiring your tokens does not prevent a subscriber from unsubscribing.

### Periodic Clean Up

It would be a good idea to periodically clean up your DynamoDB table to avoid retaining email addresses where `confirm` is `false` past a certain time frame.

If you are particularly concerned about data integrity, you may want to explore [On-Demand Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/backuprestore_HowItWorks.html) or [Point-in-Time Recovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/PointInTimeRecovery.html) for DynamoDB.

## Testing

This project includes unit tests to ensure the core logic functions as expected. The tests use Go's built-in testing framework and `testify/mock` for mocking AWS service clients (DynamoDB and SES).

To run the tests:

1. **Ensure Go is installed**: If not, follow the instructions to [install go here](https://go.dev/doc/install).
2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project root and run:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. **Run tests**:

    ```bash
    go test -v
    ```
